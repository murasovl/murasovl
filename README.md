## Hi there 👋 I'm Lina!

### Welcome to my <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/000000/github--v1.png" height="30"/>GitHub Profile

### About Me
As a recent Master of Science in Biophysics graduate with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry 👩‍🎓, I'm passionate about data-driven research, mathematical modeling, biochemistry, and systems biology 🔬📊. During my studies, I developed innovative tools and models for biochemical systems, which fueled my interest in data science 💻. Recently, I completed an intensive "Data Science and AI" course, where I enhanced my skills in Python, machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis 🤖📈.

Outside of academics, I’ve volunteered in various educational initiatives and spent six months traveling through Oceania and Asia 🌏. I’m also a big fan of skiing every winter ⛷️, surfing (which I picked up during my travels 🏄‍♂️), and exploring art — both discovering and creating 🎨.
